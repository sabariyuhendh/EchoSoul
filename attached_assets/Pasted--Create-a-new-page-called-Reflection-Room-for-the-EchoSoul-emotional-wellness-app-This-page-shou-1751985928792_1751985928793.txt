✨ Create a new page called "Reflection Room" for the EchoSoul emotional wellness app. This page should be added to the new redesigned navbar and also appear as a prominent tile below the main hero section on the home page.

🧘‍♀️ Purpose:
This page is designed to help users slow down, introspect, and write reflective answers to deep, meaningful questions — similar to "letters you'll never send" but more focused on self-growth, healing, and motivation.

💡 Page Design:
- Calm, minimal, modern dark-themed aesthetic matching the new unified EchoSoul look.
- Centered title: "Reflection Room" with soft, cosmic gradient text.
- Smooth entrance animations for the content area (e.g., fade-in or slide-in).
- Display one question at a time in a glassmorphic card.
- Navigation controls to cycle through questions (next/previous).
- Text area below each question for the user to type their answer.
- Save button (even if it just saves locally or to the user’s private vault).
- Option to "skip" or "shuffle" to another question.
- Soft, subtle background particles or cosmic sparkles for immersive feel.
- Proper top padding so content starts below the navbar without overlap.

🌈 Add the following set of introspective and motivational questions:

Self-discovery & identity
- Who are you when no one is watching?
- What values matter most to you right now?
- What do you want people to remember you for?
- What parts of yourself are you most proud of?
- What parts of yourself do you still want to heal?

Growth & change
- What habits are holding you back from your goals?
- How have you grown in the last year?
- If you could give your past self advice, what would it be?
- What’s something you want to start saying "yes" to more?
- What’s something you need to start saying "no" to?

Emotions & feelings
- What emotions are you avoiding lately?
- When did you last truly feel at peace?
- What small moment recently made you feel grateful?
- What makes you feel most alive?
- When do you feel most like yourself?

Dreams & future
- Where do you see yourself in five years, emotionally and personally?
- What would your dream day look like?
- What fears do you want to overcome in the future?
- What’s something new you'd like to learn about yourself?
- What does your ideal version of "happiness" look like?

Letting go & healing
- What are you holding on to that no longer serves you?
- Who or what do you need to forgive to feel lighter?
- What would happen if you fully let go of your expectations?
- What does freedom mean to you right now?
- What does “healing” look like for you today?

Motivation & courage
- What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?
- What scares you but excites you at the same time?
- What’s something you’ve always wanted to try but haven’t yet?
- What inspires you to keep going on tough days?
- Who do you admire, and why?

Final "letter-style" reflection
- If you could write a letter to your younger self, what would it say?
- If you could write a letter to your future self, what promises would you make?
- If you could write a message to someone who hurt you, what would you say?
- If you could write an apology to yourself, what would it include?
- If you could express one unsaid feeling today, what would it be?

✅ Add logic to allow users to save or revisit their answers anytime (stored in user vault or private reflection logs).

✅ Fix all navbar and container padding issues on this page as well.

💬 Additional note: Make sure to align the UI style (button shapes, hover animations, glassmorphism cards, cosmic particles) so it matches other EchoSoul pages and doesn't look disconnected.

✨ Goal: Create a truly personal, introspective, and healing space for users to slow down and reconnect with themselves.
