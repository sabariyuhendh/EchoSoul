🎯 ✨ EchoSoul UI & Layout Polish Prompt

Objective:
Refine the entire layout to fix blank spaces, ensure smooth scroll behavior, unify spacing, and make all modules (including Soulmate and Humour Club) feel consistent with the overall immersive, calming aesthetic.

Layout & Spacing Fixes:
- Remove all excessive blank space and prevent upward scrolling that introduces extra empty areas.
- Standardize vertical and horizontal padding so that it feels tight and balanced, without excessive breathing space.
- Ensure that on any page (including Soulmate chat), the layout stays fixed without auto-scrolling to bottom or expanding unpredictably.
- Prevent unintended vertical gaps above header or below footer, so users can’t scroll into blank space.

Soulmate Chat Fix:
- Resize the chat box to stay visually compact and not push the page downward when messages grow.
- Keep the input area fixed at the bottom of the chat container and ensure messages scroll internally rather than expanding the whole page.
- Disable auto-focus or auto-scroll on load so that it opens at the top naturally.

Humour Club UI Unification:
- Make sure the Humour Club matches the main website's modern dark glassmorphism look, including background blur, gradients, soft glows, and minimalistic card style.
- Use the same font families, color palette, and soft shadow effects as Vault, Calm Space, and other modules.
- Apply consistent border radius, hover animations, and subtle depth.

Design & Interaction Consistency:
- Smooth global scrolling (feeling fluid and not jumpy).
- Harmonize all icon styles and button shapes to look cohesive throughout.
- Check responsiveness on all screen sizes and adjust spacing accordingly.
- Keep header always clearly visible and avoid overlapping or hidden elements.

Final Deliverable:
A fully unified, immersive experience across all modules without any unexpected blank space, scroll jumps, or mismatched designs. The final result should feel warm, therapeutic, visually satisfying, and emotionally engaging while remaining professional and sleek.

Goal:
Provide users a seamless, immersive sanctuary that is both calming and joyful, without any layout distractions or inconsistencies.
