Here’s a **clean backend summary** (without code) of how the **Let It Go Room** works in EchoSoul, including how its backend is structured, the features supported, and the core backend logic:

---

## 🔧 **Let It Go Room – Backend Overview**

The **Let It Go Room** is backed by a simple yet powerful Express.js + MongoDB backend that handles emotional releases in a private, ephemeral, and secure way.

---

### ✅ **Core Backend Responsibilities**

1. **Accept Emotional Release Submissions**

   * Burn Mode: Accepts text-based anger/frustration.
   * Smash Mode: Accepts virtual object interaction data.
   * Scream Mode: Accepts vocal intensity level or short audio clip.

2. **Save Data Temporarily**

   * Each mode's entry is saved in MongoDB and is set to **automatically expire after 1 hour** using a TTL (Time-To-Live) index.
   * This ensures emotional outbursts are not permanently stored, aligning with EchoSoul’s privacy-first approach.

3. **User-Specific Data**

   * Each Let It Go action is linked to a user via their authentication token (JWT).
   * Only the logged-in user can view their past Let It Go entries (within 1 hour).

4. **No Public Feed**

   * Let It Go entries are **never shown to the community**.
   * This area remains **completely private** and transient by design.

### 🌟 **Key Backend Features**

| Feature                     | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ephemeral Storage**       | Entries auto-delete 1 hour after creation (via MongoDB TTL indexing).      |
| **JWT Authentication**      | All API calls require secure login; protects user data.                    |
| **Mode Tagging**            | Each entry is tagged as `burn`, `smash`, or `scream` for client rendering. |
| **Emotion Tags** (optional) | Can optionally log emotion (angry, sad, etc.) for analytics or styling.    |
| **API Endpoints**           | Clean RESTful APIs to submit and fetch Let It Go data for the user.        |
| **No Database Bloat**       | Expired entries are auto-purged, keeping DB lean and fast.                 |

---

### 🔐 **Privacy-Centric Design**

* Users **don’t need to worry about their emotional expressions being stored permanently**.
* No analytics or tracking is done on Let It Go entries unless explicitly configured.

### 📌 Use Case Flow (Backend Side)

1. **User chooses a mode (Burn/Smash/Scream)** and interacts with the UI.
2. **Client sends a POST request** to the backend API with the action details.
3. **Backend stores the entry** in MongoDB with a `createdAt` timestamp.
4. **TTL index ensures** the entry expires and deletes after 1 hour.
5. **If user checks their recent actions**, the GET API returns only the still-active entries.
