Please carefully update my entire EchoSoul project styling and page structure as follows:

1️⃣ Restore the original beautiful color palette used in all headings and accent text before, including gradients or subtle glow effects as previously implemented. Make sure heading text is fully visible and elegant in both light and dark modes.

2️⃣ Fix excessive vertical padding and spacing issues:
- Remove unnecessary top/bottom padding above main headings and content sections.
- Ensure the top spacing under the navbar is consistent (about 80–100px max) and doesn't expand when scrolling.

3️⃣ Remove unwanted box borders or outlines around headings and text sections. Keep headings clean, modern, and soft (no harsh border rectangles).

4️⃣ Maintain the current glassmorphism effects for buttons and cards, but ensure all text inside them is clearly visible (high contrast on all backgrounds).

5️⃣ Fix the Sign Up page 404 error:
- Ensure the `/signup` route or page exists and is linked properly from the Sign In button.
- Verify that `/signup` page uses the same design language (color palette, spacing, typography).

6️⃣ Keep existing dark mode aesthetic:
- Cosmic, modern feel with gradient or subtle background overlays.
- Soft, calm accent colors (purple, blue, teal) rather than pure black or harsh colors.

7️⃣ Remove debugging CSS or unintended inspection outlines (e.g., no orange debug borders).

8️⃣ Double-check all responsive layouts so no elements overflow or collapse awkwardly on different screen sizes.

🎨 Key design focus:
- Soft gradients or cosmic glow for headings and accents.
- Clean, elegant typography (large headings should be beautiful and inviting).
- Consistent spacing across all pages (Vault, Letters, Let It Go, Calm Space, etc.).
- Buttons remain minimal, elegant, and clearly readable.

🚨 Please make these changes consistently across the entire project so that all pages feel cohesive, polished, and premium.

Finally, please provide a short summary of what you changed (e.g., colors, spacing, typography fixes, signup page fix) after finishing.
