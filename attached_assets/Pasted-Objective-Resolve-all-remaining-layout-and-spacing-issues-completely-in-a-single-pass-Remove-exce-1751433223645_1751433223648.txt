Objective:
Resolve all remaining layout and spacing issues completely in a single pass. Remove excess blank spaces, unexpected upward scroll gaps, and large unwanted paddings. Create a perfectly unified and professional visual experience across all pages.

Global Layout & Spacing Fixes:
- Completely remove any hidden or reserved extra margin or padding above and below the main content container.
- Prevent users from scrolling upward past the top of the page (no blank white or dark empty spaces on scroll up).
- Fix the main container so it aligns exactly below the navbar without extra padding or offset.
- Ensure each page’s top content starts at the same vertical point consistently.
- Apply standardized, minimal vertical and horizontal padding to all sections, using the same base spacing unit.
- Check and correct any hidden `overflow`, `min-height`, or pseudo elements causing phantom spaces.

Navbar & Header Alignment:
- Ensure navbar does not overlap content and no artificial `padding-top` hacks are used.
- Align headings directly under the navbar without extra gaps.
- Apply smooth transitions to all page changes so there is no sudden jump or flicker when navigating.

Button & Component Consistency:
- Remove unnecessary borders around headings and buttons.
- Restore original beautiful color palette and gradients for headings and call-to-action buttons.
- Verify all text colors for contrast and restore bright accent colors as previously implemented.

Blank Space on Scroll Issue:
- Prevent content wrapper or main container from extending beyond viewport height when scrolling upward.
- Verify page’s `height`, `min-height`, and container structure — strictly avoid unintentional 100vh + extra stacking contexts.
- Confirm that no hidden divs or debugging containers are contributing to vertical overflow.

404 and Signup Page Fixes:
- Fix missing or broken signup page route (currently shows 404).
- Ensure signup and login pages share the same modern, minimal design as the rest of EchoSoul.

Soulmate (Lyra) and Humour Club Pages:
- Harmonize layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy so these pages do not feel separate or inconsistent.
- Match spacing, card sizes, text line-heights, and section paddings with the main pages.

Final Outcome:
- No extra vertical space above or below any page when scrolled.
- Consistent heading spacing and text alignment everywhere.
- Beautiful, calming color palette fully restored.
- All UI pages — Vault, Calm Space, Let It Go, Humour Club, Lyra — appear as one unified, premium, immersive experience.

Goal:
Achieve a fully polished, smooth, professional product experience — free of all spacing bugs and visual inconsistencies, while maximizing comfort and emotional engagement for the user.
